At&nbsp;<a href=\"http://tinyphx.com/blog/franks-first-peek\">Phoenix Comicon</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://tinyphx.com/blog/fest-and-back\">Fanfest</a>, on top of regular booth fees we also had to dish out an extra $200 bones for access to power. The total costs for Minefaire included only gas and extra stickers. As an added bonus, one of my besties, Joby &lt;3, lives right by the convention center and said we could crash at his place. My girlfriend, Alex, and I packed up the car and headed for the coast. Ok… I packed up the car while she laughed and said it would never work, but my Tetris skills prevailed!"
